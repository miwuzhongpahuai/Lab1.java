In the heart of the lush forest, a gentle stream meanders through the verdant landscape,
its crystal-clear waters reflecting the azure sky above. Birds chirp melodiously in the canopy,adding to the symphony of nature. Sunlight filters through the emerald leaves, painting dappled
patterns on the forest floor, today is a sunny day, and he is running on the track to relax himself.
